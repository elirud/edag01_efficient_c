4. "C" The symbol is common.  Common symbols are uninitialized data.
   "D" The symbol is in the initialized data section.
   "G" The symbol is in an initialized data section for small objects.
   "U" The symbol is undefined.
   "T" The symbol is in the text (code) section.

Optimize for size. -Os enables all -O2 optimizations except those that often increase code size.
It also enables -finline-functions, causes the compiler to tune for code size rather than execution
speed, and performs further optimizations designed to reduce code size.

5. Improvements have been observed.

6. -03 seems to introduce vector instructions. While -00 -> -02 does not.

7. --fprofile-generate will log certain events that might improve performance if the
   the outcome was known, e.g. branching, and dump this into files. These files are read on by gcc
   when using --fprofile-use and take it into consideration when optimizing.
