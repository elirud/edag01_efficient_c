    Speculative executions need rename register to avoid chaos where a speculative
    is found ot be faulty and should be discarded, but instead did write to actual register.

    Non speculative executions might still need rename registers if they are modern enough
    for out of order excution. This to avoid WAW and WAR hazards.
